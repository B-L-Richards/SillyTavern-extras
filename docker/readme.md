# Docker Usage

## Building the image

*This is assuming you have docker and docker compose installed and running.*

1. Open a terminal and set your current directory to the "docker" directory in your clone of this repo.
2. Adjust the "docker-compose.yml" file to match your needs. The default selection and the selection with all modules are provided as examples.
3. Once ready, run the command "docker compose build" to build the "cohee1207/sillytavern-extras" docker image.
